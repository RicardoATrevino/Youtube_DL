you need yt-dlp, ffmpeg, ffmprobe, ffmplay(unsure about this one). put them all in a folder named 'resources'

'resources'
          |- ffmpeg.exe
          |- ffmplay.exe
          |- ffmprobe.exe
          |- yt-dlp.exe
I originally made this app bc i dislike how online converters work. 
to-do:
add progress bar
